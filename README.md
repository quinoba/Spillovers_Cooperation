# Water Pollution Spillovers and Cooperation

## ITAM Economics Undergrad Thesis

- My thesis in pdf format can be consulted here, as well as my R Markdown document and my data for replicability.
- Most of the images in my thesis were rendered using QGIS.
- I will upload shortly my R code showing how my Clean_Data was constructed. This data was constructed using a mix of R and QGIS.

**Content Summary**

- In particular, my thesis analyzes cooperation as an alternative solution to pollution spillovers in natural resources. 
  Rivers are a classic textbook example of externalities, pollution from upstream communities is greater than socially optimal pollution since the negative effects
  will be borne by the downstream communities. Cooperation can incentivize upstream communities to take costly actions to reduce their pollution, thus benefiting 
  downstream communities.
  - My work tries to investigate whether political alignment can foster cooperation between municipalities using a political alignment dichotomous variable that indicates whether the political party of two mayors in neighboring municipalities is the same. 
  - With a Digital Elevation Model (DEM) from Mexico and GIS modeling, I determine the direction of the flow of the country's rivers and determine which communities 
  are upstream and which are downstream from each other.
  - My thesis shows evidence that water quality in mexican rivers improves on average in contexts where cooperation is fostered.
  - In the example below upstream mayor belongs to MORENA and downstream mayor to PRI, therefore this pair of municipalities would not be politically aligned hindering cooperation opportunities.
